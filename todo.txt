Find a way to build the full website with the table inside of it

Possibilities:
- Hardcoding the HTML skeleton and appending the string on the write
   - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33920896/table-within-an-html-document-using-python-list
   - using the format(<whatever you want>) to inject the table into the HTML

- Parsing the existing .html file and replacing the existing table with the updated table



NEW TODO:

- Find what needs to go on the first page
   - Maybe "RJ Barrett is":
      - xth in PPG
      - xth in APG
      - xth in RPG
      - xth in SPG
      - Maybe separate pages for those?
        - Or maybe one BIG page? hmmm
- Figure out if extra pages are needed
- Eventual CSS styling for all pages
